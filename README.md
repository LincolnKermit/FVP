Finder V-Nitro is an OSINT tool harnessing the power of search engines for information gathering.

## **Project Status Update**

The program is currently experiencing issues due to modifications in the structure of 118712.fr. I am actively working on fixing these issues. Additionally, I'm implementing compatibility for Linux and Mac systems. Your patience is appreciated during this process!
